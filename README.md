# pyShelf
A simple terminal based ebook server

Frusterated with Calibre being my only option for hosting my eBook collection, I have decided to spin up my own.

Calibre is a great organizational tool for your books, however not having a terminal based option for running and maintaining
a server is cumbersome when running on older equipment. Thus I am creating pyShelf and I hope to be able to provide all
the functionality required to organize and host all your local ebooks.

I am open to and hoping for community help in the design and execution of this program.
